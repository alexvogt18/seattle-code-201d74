# Datatypes

## what?
- a type of data 
- a way to format data that your computer can make assumptions about

**javaScript is a LOOSELY typed and DYNAMIC language**
- I do not need to specify a TYPE when defining a variable
- I can change a type after the variable has been defined initially

let pizza = null;
pizza = 'vegan cheese';
<!-- pizza = 13; -->
let nachos = 'yummy'


pizza + nachos = 'vegan cheeseyummy'

## primitive data types
- number
  - javascripts numeric datatypes - can be decimals and negative numbers
- string
  - sequence of characters used to represent text, can be letters, symbol, and number ' '
- boolean
  - a logical datatype where true or false are the possible values
- null
  - explicitly stated as none/nothing
- undefined
  - assigned to a variable when no value is assigned
