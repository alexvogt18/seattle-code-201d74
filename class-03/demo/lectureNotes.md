# Lecture Notes

## comparison operators
a == b - "loosely equal" 10 == '10' - type coercion/weak typing

a === b - "strictly equal to" 10 === 10

a != b - "not/ loosely equal || loosely NOT equal" 10 != "string" will accept diffent types WON'T accept different values

a !== b - "strictly NOT equal || NOT strictly equal" - if either is false this is true

a > b - "a is GREATER than b"

a < b - "a is LESS than b"

a >= b - "greater than OR equal too" 

a <= b - "less than OR equal too" 


## logical operators

a && b - AND BOTH HAVE TO TRUE

a || b - OR if EITHER are true, this is true

!a - BANG is not true

## loops

### What are they?
- a very common pattern
- a block of code that repeats over and over until a condition changes and is no longer true 

### why?
- saves us having write code over and over, makes it "dry"
