## const 
### what? 
- a canstant variable! Use this when we KNOW we will never reassign the variable. Use whenever possible!
### why?
- because we are not able to change this it can stop us from making mistakes

`const newVariable = 'unchanging';`

## Objects
### What??
- a container for data
- a datatype
- a convenient and powerful way to group data and functions
- stores data as properties with 'key': 'value' pairs
- arrays are a type of object! with index as their key

## DOM
### Document Object Model
- a special object that is made up of the html and css for our page
- Within our browser, when looking at a webpage, we see HTML and CSS come together to create a structure that we can in turn see headings, images, links etc....

Browsers represent the html document as a JS object. This means that we can access individual components of "The DOM" the same way we would access individual components of a JS object. `document.body.textContent = 'hi'`
